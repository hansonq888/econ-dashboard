Over this period, there is a consistent upward trend in CPI values, indicating an overall inflationary movement.\n\n- **Starting Value (Oct 2020):** 260.319\n- **Ending Value (Aug 2025):** 323.364\n\nThe CPI increased steadily, with several notable monthly growth rates. From October 2020 to December 2021, the CPI rose from 260.319 to 280.806, marking an increase of approximately 7.9%. The growth accelerated in subsequent periods, particularly from late 2021 through 2023, as evidenced by increases like 11.3% from December 2021 to December 2022.\n\nIn the more recent months, the CPI has shown a gradual increase, reaching 308.735 by December 2023 and forecasted to climb to approximately 323.364 by August 2025. This suggests a projected overall increase of around 24.2% over the five-year span, highlighting ongoing inflation pressures in the economy. \n\nOverall, the data indicates a long-term inflation trend likely influenced by various economic factors, including supply chain disruptions and shifts in consumer demand."
