A gradual decline to 0.06% occurred in May 2021, but was followed by a slight recovery to 0.10% in July 2021. \n\nThe trend then shifted significantly, with notable increases beginning in early 2022. From a rate of 0.08% in February 2022, it rose sharply over the subsequent months, reaching 4.10% by December 2022. The rate continued to rise, reaching a peak of 5.33% by August 2023, where it remained stable for several months.\n\nIn the latter part of 2024, a gradual decline began, with rates dropping to 4.48% by December 2024. The rate then stabilized again between 4.22% and 4.33% from January to September 2025. \n\nOverall, the data illustrates a significant increase in the Federal Funds Rate after a period of stability at low levels, marking a robust response to economic conditions."
