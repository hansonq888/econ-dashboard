As of September 2023, the rate was 3.8%, indicating a slight upward shift from its lowest point. Looking ahead to 2025, the values are projected to remain around the 4.0% mark, reflecting a modest but stable labor market. \n\nOverall, the trend indicates a recovery in employment levels, with a slight increase in rates expected in the near term but still within historically low ranges."
